        <div class="block">
            <div>
                Said the ever-peculiar lead scientist. His bleeding crimson goggles almost completely obscuring a look of disdain in his sleepless eyes, a look not missed by the contributor Rebecca.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div>
                It was a rare visit to the facility, the air was stale and still with a hint of the familiar seas. Dressed in a finer gown in all black much like the others in The Blacksite, Rebecca Fritz found herself at a crossroads.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="speaker">REBECCA</div>
            <div>
                “Don’t look at me like as if you have any say in this, Stitch. I’m not here to listen.”
            </div>
        </div>

                “With Misfortune indefinitely out of the picture, there’s the matter of a replacement.”

        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="speaker">STITCH</div>
            <div>
                Stitch shook his head, “I’m telling you to have faith in her. We do not need to resort to this… statue. Misfortune’s tenacity to pursue is unmatched as a closer.”
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div>
                He complained, with lack of a better term. The mistress’ lips parted as if to speak, until Stitch continued abruptly with a question.
            </div>

        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div>
                The researcher asked with a hushed tone. He looked directly at Rebecca for a moment, before looking ahead again upon catching an almost offended leer back.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="speaker">REBECCA</div>

        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div>
                Rebecca answered, stepping away from the desk. A glance away as her footsteps clacked behind the researcher, who wouldn’t dare move.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="speaker">REBECCA</div>

                She played along, leaning herself forwards over an agent file, now at Stitch’s right side. He felt surrounded, the room felt a few shades darker.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="speaker">STITCH</div>

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div>
                He stopped himself, adjusting his goggles in a fidget, “Sorry. We are well aware of how one’s magical aura can disturb another if they have the right eye for it.”
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="speaker">REBECCA</div>

                “How one can read intentions from them. Superstitious folk, especially in Mainland try and read how one’s power bleeds from them at rest. They say you can tell if a person is lying, or if they’re hiding something from you. Or intend to strike.”
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div>
                Stitch stopped himself from going on. He knew how little Rebecca cared for the details.

                Rebecca said with a dismissive tone, clearly unbothered—or ignorant—of Stitch’s unnerved attitude.

        <div class="block">
            <div>
                Rebecca took the photo into her hand, dangling it right in front of the research head’s eyes.

                Rebecca craned her arm away from between Stitch’s eyes, with her head tilted up, a gleeful grin on her face almost as despicable as the one on the photo.
